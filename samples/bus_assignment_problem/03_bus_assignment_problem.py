========================================================

This module demonstrates the implementation and solution of a realistic Bus Assignment Problem using
the OptiX mathematical optimization framework with Goal Programming techniques. This example showcases
advanced optimization modeling for public transportation systems, demonstrating practical applications
of multi-objective optimization theory to real-world transit planning and fleet management scenarios.

The implementation provides a comprehensive example of modeling complex multi-constraint transportation
problems using OptiX's Goal Programming capabilities, demonstrating advanced data modeling, constraint
formulation, objective function definition, and solution analysis techniques for operational research
in public transit systems.

Historical Background:
    Bus assignment and scheduling problems emerged as critical challenges in urban transportation
    planning during the rapid urbanization of the mid-20th century. The mathematical formulation
    of these problems draws from several key areas of operations research:
    
    - **Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP)**: First formulated by Dantzig and Ramser in 1959
    - **Transit Network Design**: Developed during the 1960s-1970s urban planning boom
    - **Goal Programming**: Introduced by Charnes and Cooper in 1961 for multi-objective optimization
    - **Public Transportation Planning**: Evolved from airline scheduling optimization techniques
    
    The complexity of modern transit systems, with multiple bus types, overlapping routes, capacity
    constraints, and service quality requirements, necessitated the development of sophisticated
    optimization approaches. Goal Programming became particularly relevant for transit planning
    because it allows balancing competing objectives like cost minimization, service quality
    maximization, and resource utilization optimization.

Problem Description:
    This Bus Assignment Problem seeks to determine the optimal allocation of different bus types
    across multiple transit lines while satisfying passenger demand, respecting fleet limitations,
    and maintaining service quality standards. The problem incorporates realistic operational
    constraints including:
    
    **Decision Variables**: The number of trips each bus group performs on each transit line
    **Primary Objective**: Goal Programming optimization (minimize deviations from targets)
    **Constraints**: Multiple constraint types ensuring operational feasibility and service quality
    
    **Mathematical Formulation**:
    
    Goal Programming Formulation:
    - Primary: Minimize goal deviations (fleet utilization targets)
    - Subject to multiple constraint types described below
    
    **Constraint Categories**:
    1. **Bus Group Restrictions**: Certain bus types banned from specific lines
    2. **Minimum Service Requirements**: Each line must have at least one trip
    3. **Fleet Capacity Limits**: Cannot exceed available buses per group (Goal Constraints)
    4. **Passenger Demand Satisfaction**: Meet minimum passenger capacity on each line
    5. **Line Segment Demand**: Satisfy passenger demand on individual route segments

Real-World Problem Complexity:
    This implementation models a realistic transit scenario with:
    
    - **Multiple Bus Types**: 5 different bus groups (A-E) with varying capacities and fleet sizes
    - **Transit Network**: 4 main lines (114, 115, 120, 121) with different operational characteristics
    - **Route Segments**: 11 specific line segments with individual passenger demand requirements
    - **Operational Constraints**: Bus type restrictions, timing constraints, and capacity limitations
    - **Service Quality**: Minimum service guarantees and passenger demand satisfaction

Modern Applications:
    This type of bus assignment optimization has widespread applications in transportation systems:
    
    - **Urban Transit Agencies**: Daily operational planning and fleet allocation
    - **Regional Transportation**: Coordinating multiple bus types across service areas
    - **School District Transportation**: Optimizing bus assignments for student transportation

    Main function implementing the complete Goal Programming bus assignment optimization workflow.
    
    This function demonstrates the end-to-end process of formulating, solving, and analyzing
    a comprehensive bus assignment problem using OptiX's Goal Programming capabilities. It showcases
    advanced optimization modeling techniques for real-world transportation systems, including
    multi-objective optimization, complex constraint hierarchies, and sophisticated data relationships.
    
    The implementation follows a systematic approach for complex transportation optimization
    problems involving multiple constraint types, Goal Programming objectives, prohibition
    constraints, and multi-level demand satisfaction requirements.
    
    Workflow Overview:
        1. **Goal Programming Initialization**: Create OXGPProblem instance for multi-objective optimization
        2. **Database Population**: Load realistic transit system data including bus groups, lines, and segments
        3. **Cross-Product Variable Generation**: Create assignment variables for each bus group-line combination
        4. **Prohibition Constraint Formulation**: Enforce bus type restrictions on specific lines
        5. **Minimum Service Constraints**: Ensure at least one trip per transit line
        6. **Goal Programming Fleet Constraints**: Optimize fleet utilization within available capacity
        7. **Line Demand Satisfaction**: Meet passenger demand requirements for each transit line
        8. **Segment Demand Satisfaction**: Satisfy passenger demand on individual route segments
        9. **Goal Programming Optimization**: Solve using OR-Tools with Goal Programming support
        10. **Solution Analysis**: Display and validate comprehensive optimization results
    
    Problem Complexity Features:
        **Advanced OptiX Capabilities Demonstrated**:
        - **Goal Programming (OXGPProblem)**: Multi-objective optimization with goal constraints
        - **Prohibition Constraints**: Bus type restrictions using equality constraints (= 0)
        - **Multi-Level Demand Modeling**: Both line-level and segment-level passenger requirements
        - **UUID-Based Relationships**: Complex data object cross-references and banned groups
        - **Advanced Variable Naming**: Human-readable names using data object attributes
        - **Goal Constraint Formulation**: Fleet capacity optimization with soft constraints
        
        **Real-World Operational Constraints**:
        - **Bus Type Restrictions**: Certain vehicles banned from specific routes
        - **Fleet Capacity Limits**: Cannot exceed available buses considering trip duration
        - **Service Quality Requirements**: Minimum trip frequency per line
        - **Passenger Demand Satisfaction**: Adequate capacity for both lines and segments
        - **Operational Timing**: Duration-based fleet capacity calculations
    
    Constraint Structure (5 types):
        1. **Prohibition Constraints** (selective application):
           For banned bus groups on specific lines:
           Î£(trips[banned_group][line]) = 0
           
        2. **Minimum Service Constraints** (one per line):
           For each transit line:
           Î£(trips[bus_group][line]) â‰¥ 1
           
        3. **Fleet Capacity Goal Constraints** (one per bus group):
           For each bus group (Goal Programming - soft constraints):
           Î£(trips[bus_group][line] Ã— line.total_duration) / time_period â‰¤ bus_group.number_of_busses
           
        4. **Line Demand Constraints** (one per line):
           For each transit line:
           Î£(bus_group.total_capacity Ã— trips[bus_group][line]) â‰¥ line.passenger_demand
           
        5. **Segment Demand Constraints** (multiple per segment):
           For each line segment and each related line:
           Î£(bus_group.total_capacity Ã— trips[bus_group][related_line]) â‰¥ segment.passenger_demand
    
    Goal Programming Methodology:
        **Goal Constraints vs Hard Constraints**:
        - **Goal Constraints**: Fleet capacity limits (allow deviations with penalties)
        - **Hard Constraints**: Service requirements and demand satisfaction (must be satisfied)
        - **Objective Function**: Minimize deviations from fleet utilization goals
        - **Multi-Objective Balance**: Optimize fleet efficiency while maintaining service quality
    
    Variable Structure:
        **Decision Variables**: trips[bus_group][line] representing number of trips
        **Variable Properties**:
        - **Name Template**: "# of Trips of Bus Group {busgroup_name} on Line {line_name}"
        - **Description**: Detailed explanation of assignment relationship
        - **Lower Bound**: 0 (non-negativity constraint)
        - **Upper Bound**: 2000 (operational upper limit)
        - **Variable Count**: 20 variables (5 bus groups Ã— 4 lines)
    
    Problem Instance Characteristics:
        **Fleet Composition**: 5 bus groups with varying capacities (103-165 passengers) and fleet sizes (2-14 buses)
        **Route Network**: 4 transit lines with different operational characteristics and passenger demands
        **Route Segments**: 11 detailed segments with individual passenger demand requirements
        **Operational Restrictions**: Bus type prohibitions on 3 of 4 lines for high-capacity vehicles
        **Timing Constraints**: Variable trip durations (75-115 minutes) affecting fleet capacity
    
    Advanced Features:
        **UUID-Based Relationships**: 
        - Line.banned_groups references specific BusGroup IDs
        - LineSegment.related_lines references multiple Line IDs
        - Complex cross-referencing enabling sophisticated constraint formulations
        
        **Multi-Level Constraint Hierarchy**:
        - System-level: Fleet capacity and service frequency
        - Line-level: Passenger demand satisfaction
        - Segment-level: Detailed route capacity requirements
        
        **Goal Programming Integration**:
        - Fleet utilization as goal constraints (soft, allowing deviations)
        - Service requirements as hard constraints (must be satisfied)
        - Balanced optimization between efficiency and service quality
    
    Solver Configuration:
        **Optimization Engine**: OR-Tools (supports Goal Programming)
        **Problem Type**: Goal Programming with mixed constraint types
        **Denominator Equalization**: Enabled for handling fractional coefficients
        **Variable Type**: Continuous (allows fractional trip assignments)
    
    Expected Solution Characteristics:
        **Goal Programming Optimality**:
        - Minimizes deviations from fleet utilization targets
        - Satisfies all hard constraints (service and demand requirements)
        - Balances efficiency with operational requirements
        - May show under-utilization of some bus groups to maintain service quality
        
        **Operational Insights**:
        - High-capacity buses (Group E) used only on unrestricted Line 120
        - Standard buses distributed across all lines based on demand
        - Fleet capacity constraints may be binding for smaller bus groups
        - Segment demand requirements may drive additional capacity allocation
    
    Performance Characteristics:
        **Problem Scale**: Medium complexity with 20 variables and 50+ constraints
        **Solving Time**: 1-3 seconds for this realistic problem instance
        **Memory Usage**: Moderate requirements for complex data structures
        **Solution Quality**: Goal Programming provides balanced multi-objective solutions
        **Scalability**: Methodology extends to larger transit networks and additional objectives
    
    Educational Value:
        This implementation demonstrates:
        - **Goal Programming Techniques**: Multi-objective optimization with soft constraints
        - **Complex Transportation Modeling**: Real-world transit system characteristics
        - **Advanced OptiX Features**: Sophisticated constraint types and data relationships
        - **Operational Research Applications**: Practical optimization for public transit
        - **Multi-Level Problem Decomposition**: Hierarchical constraint structures
        - **Data-Driven Optimization**: Realistic operational parameters and relationships
    
    Returns:
        None: Results are printed to console including Goal Programming optimization status,
              detailed trip assignments with constraint satisfaction analysis, goal deviation
              reporting, and comprehensive solution validation across all constraint types.
              
    Raises:
        Solver exceptions: May occur if OR-Tools encounters numerical issues or if
                          the problem becomes infeasible due to conflicting constraints.
        Data consistency errors: If UUID relationships are broken or if operational
                               parameters create impossible constraint combinations.
        
    Note:
        This function serves as a comprehensive example of advanced optimization modeling
        for transportation systems, demonstrating the full capabilities of OptiX's Goal
        Programming framework for complex, multi-objective operational research problems.
