Academic Free License v. 3.0
-----------------------------

This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of authorship 
(the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the following licensing 
notice adjacent to the copyright notice for the Original Work:

**Licensed under the Academic Free License version 3.0**

1) **Grant of Copyright License.** Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, 
   non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to do 
   the following:

   a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a 
      collective work;

   b) to translate, adapt, alter, transform, modify, or arrange the Original Work, 
      thereby creating derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original Work;

   c) to distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works 
      to the public, under any license of your choice that does not contradict the 
      terms and conditions, including Licensor's reserved rights and remedies, in 
      this Academic Free License;

   d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and

   e) to display the Original Work publicly.

2) **Grant of Patent License.** Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, 
   non-exclusive, sublicensable license, under patent claims owned or controlled 
   by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the 
   Licensor, for the duration of the patents, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, 
   have made, and import the Original Work and Derivative Works.

3) **Grant of Source Code License.** The term "Source Code" means the preferred 
   form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available 
   documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor agrees to 
   provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along 
   with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves 
   the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the 
   Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit 
   inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to 
   distribute the Original Work.

4) **Exclusions From License Grant.** Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names 
   of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service 
   marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original 
   Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as expressly 
   stated herein, nothing in this License grants any license to Licensor's 
   trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property. 
   No patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or 
   import embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined 
   in Section 2. No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such 
   marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be 
   interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different from this 
   License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

5) **External Deployment.** The term "External Deployment" means the use, distribution, 
   or communication of the Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that 
   the Original Work or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, 
   whether those works are distributed or communicated to those persons or made 
   available as an application intended for use over a network. As an express 
   condition for the grants of license hereunder, You must treat any External 
   Deployment by You of the Original Work or a Derivative Work as a distribution 
   under section 1(c).

6) **Attribution Rights.** You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative 
   Works that You create, all copyright, patent, or trademark notices from the 
   Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any 
   descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause 
   the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent 
   Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have 
   modified the Original Work.

7) **Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty.** Licensor warrants that 
   the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein 
   by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms 
   of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights 
   and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately preceding 
   sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS 
   and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, 
   the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular 
   purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. 
   This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No 
   license to the Original Work is granted by this License except under this disclaimer.

8) **Limitation of Liability.** Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, 
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the 
   Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or 
   consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or 
   the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss 
   of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all 
   other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not 
   apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.

9) **Acceptance and Termination.** If, at any time, You expressly assented to this 
   License, that assent indicates your acceptance of this License and all of its 
   terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original 
   Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the 
   circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this 
   License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed 
   in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the 
   Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is 
   prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License 
   is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations (including "fair use" 
   or "fair dealing"). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no 
   longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your 
   failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).

10) **Termination for Patent Action.** This License shall terminate automatically 
    and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License 
    as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, 
    against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a 
    patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent 
    infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.

11) **Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law.** Any action or suit relating to this 
    License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor 
    resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws 
    of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application 
    of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of 
    Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of 
    this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and 
    penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This 
    section shall survive the termination of this License.

12) **Attorneys' Fees.** In any action to enforce the terms of this License or 
    seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to 
    recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable 
    attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including 
    any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.

13) **Miscellaneous.** If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, 
    such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.

14) **Definition of "You" in This License.** "You" throughout this License, whether 
    in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights 
    under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, 
    "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common 
    control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the 
    power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, 
    whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or 
    more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

15) **Right to Use.** You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise 
    restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not 
    to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

16) **Modification of This License.** This License is Copyright © 2005 Lawrence Rosen. 
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License without 
    modification. Nothing in this License permits You to modify this License as 
    applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You may modify 
    the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your modified 
    version (the "Modified License") and apply it to other original works of 
    authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in 
    any way that your Modified License is the "Academic Free License" or "AFL" 
    and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You 
    must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph above with a notice 
    of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in this License; and 
    (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open source software 
    unless your Modified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) 
    and You comply with its license review and certification process.
