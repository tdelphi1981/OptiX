Optimization Solvers Module
============================

This module provides comprehensive optimization solver integration for the OptiX mathematical
optimization framework. It implements a unified multi-solver architecture that enables seamless
switching between different optimization engines while maintaining consistent problem formulation,
solving workflows, and solution analysis capabilities across diverse algorithmic approaches.

The module serves as the central hub for mathematical optimization operations within OptiX,
abstracting away solver-specific implementation details and providing standardized interfaces
for solving complex constraint satisfaction, linear programming, and goal programming problems
using industry-standard commercial and open-source optimization engines.

Architecture:
    - **Unified Interface**: Standardized solver abstraction enabling consistent access to
      diverse optimization engines through common method signatures and data structures
    - **Multi-Solver Support**: Seamless integration of commercial solvers (Gurobi), 
      open-source solvers (OR-Tools), and custom algorithmic implementations
    - **Factory Pattern**: Centralized solver instantiation and management with dynamic
      discovery and configuration capabilities for optimal resource utilization
    - **Extensible Design**: Plugin-based architecture supporting easy integration of
      new solver backends without modifying existing framework components

Key Components:
    - **OXSolverInterface**: Abstract base class defining the standard interface that all
      concrete solver implementations must implement, ensuring behavioral consistency
      and enabling polymorphic solver usage across different optimization scenarios
    - **OXSolverFactory**: Central factory providing unified problem-solving interface
      with automated solver selection, parameter management, and workflow orchestration
    - **OXSolverSolution**: Comprehensive solution data structure capturing variable
      assignments, constraint evaluations, objective values, and optimization metadata
    - **OXSolutionStatus**: Standardized status enumeration providing consistent
      interpretation of solution quality and termination conditions across solvers

Solver Ecosystem:
    The module integrates multiple optimization solver backends:
    
    - **OR-Tools Integration**: Google's open-source constraint programming and linear
      optimization suite featuring CP-SAT solver with advanced constraint propagation,
      presolving techniques, and efficient discrete optimization algorithms
    - **Gurobi Integration**: Commercial high-performance optimization solver with
      state-of-the-art algorithms for linear, quadratic, and mixed-integer programming
      including advanced presolving, cutting planes, and heuristic methods
    - **Custom Solvers**: Extensible framework supporting integration of specialized
      solvers, academic implementations, and domain-specific optimization algorithms

Problem Type Support:
    The solver module comprehensively supports various optimization paradigms:
    
    - **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)**: Logical constraint satisfaction with
      variable domain pruning, constraint propagation, and feasible solution enumeration
    - **Linear Programming (LP)**: Continuous optimization with linear objectives and
      constraints using simplex, interior-point, and barrier algorithms
    - **Goal Programming (GP)**: Multi-objective optimization with deviation variables,
      priority levels, and hierarchical objective function management
    - **Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP)**: Combined continuous and discrete optimization
      with branch-and-bound, cutting plane, and heuristic solution techniques

Usage Patterns:
    The module provides multiple interface levels for different use cases:

    .. code-block:: python

        from solvers import solve
        from solvers.OXSolverInterface import OXSolutionStatus
        from problem.OXProblem import OXLPProblem
        
        # High-level unified interface (recommended)
        problem = OXLPProblem()
        x = problem.create_decision_variable("x", 0, 10)
        y = problem.create_decision_variable("y", 0, 10)
        problem.create_constraint([x, y], [1, 1], "<=", 15)
        problem.create_objective_function([x, y], [2, 3], "maximize")
        
        # Solve with automatic solver selection and setup
        status, solver = solve(problem, 'ORTools', maxTime=300)
        
        # Multi-solver comparison
        or_status, or_solver = solve(problem, 'ORTools')
        gurobi_status, gurobi_solver = solve(problem, 'Gurobi')
        
        # Solution analysis and comparison
        if or_status == OXSolutionStatus.OPTIMAL:
            or_solution = or_solver[0]
            print(f"OR-Tools: {or_solution.objective_function_value}")
            
        if gurobi_status == OXSolutionStatus.OPTIMAL:
            gurobi_solution = gurobi_solver[0]
            print(f"Gurobi: {gurobi_solution.objective_function_value}")

Advanced Features:
    The solver module provides sophisticated optimization capabilities:
    
    - **Parameter Customization**: Flexible solver parameter configuration enabling
      fine-grained control over algorithmic behavior, performance tuning, and solution quality
    - **Multi-Solution Enumeration**: Support for finding multiple optimal or near-optimal
      solutions with configurable enumeration limits and diversity constraints
    - **Solution Validation**: Comprehensive constraint satisfaction verification and
      objective function value validation with numerical tolerance handling
    - **Performance Monitoring**: Detailed timing, memory usage, and algorithmic statistics
      for optimization performance analysis and debugging

Solver Selection Guidelines:
    Choose the appropriate solver based on problem characteristics and requirements:
    
    - **OR-Tools (ORTools)**: Recommended for constraint satisfaction problems, discrete
      optimization scenarios, and applications requiring advanced constraint types
      with excellent open-source support and no licensing requirements
    - **Gurobi**: Optimal for large-scale linear and quadratic programming requiring
      commercial-grade performance, numerical stability, and advanced optimization
      algorithms with professional support and licensing
    - **Custom Implementations**: Consider for specialized problem domains, research
      applications, or when specific algorithmic approaches are required

Performance Considerations:
    - Solver instantiation overhead minimized through efficient registry lookup
    - Problem setup optimized for large-scale formulations with thousands of variables
    - Memory usage scales linearly with problem size and solution enumeration
    - Parallel solving capabilities depend on individual solver implementations
    - Cross-solver solution verification enables reliability and quality assurance

Error Handling:
    The module implements comprehensive error management:
    
    - Solver availability validation with meaningful error messages
    - Parameter validation and type checking with detailed error reporting
    - Graceful handling of numerical issues and solver-specific exceptions
    - Standardized exception translation for consistent error management

Integration Notes:
    - All solver implementations follow consistent interface contracts
