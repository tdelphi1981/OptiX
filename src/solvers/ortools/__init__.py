OR-Tools Solver Integration Module
===================================

This module provides comprehensive integration between the OptiX optimization framework
and Google's OR-Tools constraint programming solver. It implements the OptiX solver
interface using OR-Tools' CP-SAT engine to enable solving complex discrete optimization
problems including constraint satisfaction, integer programming, and goal programming.

The module serves as a critical component of OptiX's multi-solver architecture, offering
high-performance constraint programming capabilities alongside other solver backends
like Gurobi for different optimization scenarios.

Architecture:
    - **Solver Interface**: Complete implementation of OXSolverInterface for OR-Tools
    - **Constraint Programming**: Leverages CP-SAT for discrete optimization excellence
    - **Multi-Problem Support**: Handles CSP, LP, and GP problem types seamlessly
    - **Advanced Constraints**: Supports complex non-linear constraint relationships

Key Components:
    - **OXORToolsSolverInterface**: Primary solver implementation class providing complete
      integration with OR-Tools CP-SAT solver including variable management, constraint
      translation, objective handling, and solution extraction capabilities

Solver Capabilities:
    - **Variable Types**: Boolean and bounded integer decision variables with automatic
      type detection based on variable bounds and mathematical properties
    - **Linear Constraints**: Full support for relational operators (=, <=, >=, <, >)
      with efficient constraint expression evaluation and validation
    - **Special Constraints**: Advanced non-linear relationships including:
      
      * **Multiplicative**: Product relationships between multiple variables
      * **Division/Modulo**: Integer division and remainder operations for discrete math
      * **Summation**: Explicit sum constraints for complex variable relationships  
      * **Conditional**: If-then-else logic with indicator variables for decision modeling
      
    - **Objective Functions**: Optimization support for minimization and maximization
      with linear and goal programming objective types
    - **Multi-Solution Enumeration**: Configurable solution collection with callback
      mechanisms for exploring solution spaces and alternative optima
    - **Performance Tuning**: Comprehensive parameter configuration for time limits,
      solution counts, and algorithmic behavior customization

Mathematical Features:
    - **Float Coefficient Handling**: Automatic denominator equalization for fractional
      weights enabling seamless integration of real-valued problem formulations
    - **Integer Programming**: Native support for discrete optimization with advanced
      branching and cutting plane algorithms from OR-Tools
    - **Constraint Propagation**: Sophisticated constraint propagation techniques for
      efficient problem space reduction and faster solving

Configuration Parameters:
    The solver accepts multiple parameters for fine-tuning performance and behavior:
    
    - **equalizeDenominators** (bool): Enables automatic conversion of float coefficients
      to integers using common denominator calculation, allowing OR-Tools to handle
      fractional weights in constraints and objectives. Default: False
      
    - **solutionCount** (int): Maximum number of solutions to enumerate during solving.
      Higher values enable comprehensive solution space exploration but increase
      computational overhead. Default: 1
      
    - **maxTime** (int): Maximum solving time in seconds before automatic termination.
      Prevents indefinite solving on computationally difficult problem instances.
      Default: 600 seconds (10 minutes)

Integration Patterns:
    The module follows OptiX's standardized solver integration patterns for consistent
    usage across different solver backends:

    .. code-block:: python

        from problem.OXProblem import OXCSPProblem, OXLPProblem
        from solvers.ortools import OXORToolsSolverInterface
        from solvers.OXSolverFactory import solve
        
        # Direct solver instantiation approach
        problem = OXCSPProblem()
        # ... configure problem variables and constraints ...
        
        solver = OXORToolsSolverInterface(
            equalizeDenominators=True,
            solutionCount=5,
            maxTime=300
        )
        
        solver.create_variables(problem)
        solver.create_constraints(problem)
        solver.create_special_constraints(problem)
        status = solver.solve(problem)
        
        # Factory pattern approach (recommended)
        problem = OXLPProblem()
        # ... configure problem ...
        
        status, solutions = solve(problem, "ORTools", 
                                 equalizeDenominators=True,
                                 solutionCount=10,
                                 maxTime=600)

Performance Considerations:
    - OR-Tools CP-SAT excels at discrete optimization problems with complex constraints
    - Integer variable domains should be bounded for optimal performance
    - Large solution enumeration (>100 solutions) may require increased time limits
    - Float coefficient conversion adds preprocessing overhead but enables broader compatibility
    - Special constraints leverage native CP-SAT primitives for efficient solving

Compatibility:
    - **Python Version**: Requires Python 3.7 or higher for full feature support
    - **OR-Tools Version**: Compatible with OR-Tools 9.0+ constraint programming library
    - **OptiX Framework**: Fully integrated with OptiX problem modeling and solving architecture
    - **Operating Systems**: Cross-platform support on Windows, macOS, and Linux

Use Cases:
    This solver implementation is particularly well-suited for:
    
    - Scheduling and resource allocation problems with discrete time slots
    - Combinatorial optimization problems with complex constraint relationships
    - Integer programming formulations requiring advanced constraint types
    - Multi-objective optimization with goal programming approaches
    - Constraint satisfaction problems with large solution spaces requiring enumeration

Notes:
    - For continuous optimization problems, consider using the Gurobi solver interface
    - Large-scale linear programming may benefit from specialized LP solver backends
    - Memory usage scales with problem size and solution enumeration requirements
    - Solver logs and debugging information available through get_solver_logs() method
