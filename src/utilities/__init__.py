Utilities Module
================

This module provides essential utility functions and helper classes for the OptiX 
optimization framework. It implements core infrastructure components that support 
dynamic class loading, reflection operations, and other fundamental capabilities 
used throughout the framework's architecture.

The utilities module is designed with a focus on:

Architecture:
    - **Dynamic Class Loading**: Runtime class discovery and instantiation capabilities
    - **Reflection Utilities**: Class introspection and metadata extraction tools
    - **Type Safety**: Robust error handling with framework-specific exceptions
    - **Performance**: Optimized implementations leveraging Python's import caching

Key Components:
    - **Class Loaders**: Dynamic class loading and fully qualified name resolution
    - **Reflection Tools**: Runtime class inspection and metadata operations
    - **Import Utilities**: Safe dynamic module importing with comprehensive error handling

Core Functions:
    - **get_fully_qualified_name**: Generate standardized class identifiers for serialization
    - **load_class**: Dynamically load classes from their fully qualified names

Use Cases:
    - Serialization and deserialization of complex object hierarchies
    - Plugin-style architecture with runtime class discovery
    - Configuration-driven object instantiation patterns
    - Framework extensibility and dynamic loading mechanisms
    - Type preservation across serialization boundaries

Usage:
    Import utility functions for dynamic class operations:

    .. code-block:: python

        from utilities import get_fully_qualified_name, load_class
        from base.OXObject import OXObject
        
        # Generate standardized class identifier
        class_id = get_fully_qualified_name(OXObject)
        print(class_id)  # Output: 'base.OXObject'
        
        # Dynamically load and instantiate class
        loaded_class = load_class(class_id)
        instance = loaded_class()
        
        # Verify roundtrip integrity
        assert loaded_class is OXObject

Performance Considerations:
    - Module imports are cached by Python's import system for efficiency
    - Class loading operations are thread-safe and optimized for repeated use
    - Minimal overhead for reflection operations through efficient attribute access

Notes:
    - All utility functions include comprehensive error handling
    - Operations are designed to be thread-safe for concurrent usage
    - Framework-specific exceptions provide detailed error context
    - Functions follow OptiX naming conventions and patterns
